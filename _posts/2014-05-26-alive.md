Jeizinen Prototyper is still a side project that I don't use really on projects, so progress has been slow. As with the release of a new Meteor Version (which is framework this is based on) I need to rewrite a lot because a new templating engine was introduced.

I will soon publish the current state, even if it still has a lot of bumps. I want to get it ready until Summer to use it in client projects.

I was quite inspired by [Memi Beltrame's](http://lessamess.ch/) talk about Data Driven Development at [UX Camp Switzerland](http://www.uxcamp.ch):

With [Protostrap](http://protostrap.ch) he is working on something similar to Jeizinen Prototyper. It is the only other project in this direction that I know of. For him it was especially important to use real data that users can relate to.

I believe he is right to use data which is as realistic as possible. So while trying to work out all the bugs with the current implementation, I programmed the possibility to easily add data by just placing as csv or yaml file in the right folder. Quite simple, but very useful and exciting stuff. I will show soon, how it works!
