I finally attached a license. I myself almost considered the project to be dead. But I actually used it for very small projects. It is just so quick to set up a project. Two commands on the command line and I have my prototyping project ready, also deployment is just another command.

So I license it MIT. No reason to limit access and usage.

In the last few days, I also made forms smarter, now any input fields will be saved to a session or to a document of a collection. See [documentation](https://rolandstuder.github.io/jeizinen-meteor/index.html#autosaving)
