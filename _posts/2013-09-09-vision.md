> UI Prototyper enables people with basic HTML/CSS/Javascript skills to **quickly** create **highly interactive** prototypes for web applications.

### Approach

* Video instructions will get you started quickly.
* For the typical interactions you want to prototype, you will not have to touch Javascript.
* Your possibilities to use UI prototyper will grow with your growing programming skills.
* The framework will never restrict you in your possibilities, if you want to integrate any javascript, you will be able to do so.
