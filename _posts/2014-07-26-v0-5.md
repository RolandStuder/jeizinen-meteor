You can now filter collections by using the `filter`-helper in a an html-element.

    <a {{filter collection="collectionName" field="fieldName" value="string"}}

If this element is clicked, the collection will be filtered by searching for documents that have the value "string" in the field "fieldname". The filtering will persists across page switches, to show all elements again you have to reset by filtering `value=""`.
