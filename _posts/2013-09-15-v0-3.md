### Layouts / Pages and a navigation that automatically shows where you are

	localhost:3000/layoutName/parentNavigation.yourTemplate

	# layoutName - will render the layout with this name and render the page at {{> renderPage }}
	# parentNavigation - links pointing to parentNavigation will get class 'active'
	# yourTemplate - the template with the name 'yourTemplate' will by displayed

### Random data like names and phonenumbers

	{{random 'name'}}

Will return a random combinations of a first name and a family name. Other options are:

	{{random 'firstName'}}
	{{random 'familyName'}}
	{{random 'phoneNumber'}}
	{{random 'email'}}

more to come... (dates, birthdays)

#### Random pick of a list defined by yourself

	{{pick 'The Alliance, The Rebels, Neutral'}}

Will return one of the comma-separated options.

### Lists of objects with random data

You can create sets of datas, called collections, and can use them in your views without defining them beforehand. For example you can create a list of people like this:

	{{#collection name='people' create='10'}}
		{{field 'name'}}
	{{/collection}}

This will output a list of 10 names. **This data is saved and will not change, if you switch between pages.** However if you reload a page, the collections are reset.

If you use on the options that work for the random helper, it automatically returns a random value. More possibilities are available:

	{{#collection name='people' create='10'}}
		{{field 'name' random="firstName"}} // will give you a random first name
		{{field 'category' pick="a,b,c"}} // will return a random pick
	{{/collection}}
