===============

ui prototyping framework for meteor, very alpha...

The vision is to create a very fast prototyping framework, to create interactive prototypes for user-testing, demonstration or as specification for developers. 

In the long run, the idea is to support easily editable mock-data.

Technically it is a meteorite package for meteor.
